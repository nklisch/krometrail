# Krometrail

MCP server + CLI that gives AI agents runtime debugging via the Debug Adapter Protocol.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  cli/          CLI entry point + commands (citty)
  mcp/          MCP server entry + tool handlers (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
  core/         Session manager, viewport renderer, DAP client, value renderer
  adapters/     Language-specific debugger adapters
  browser/      Browser CDP session, lens pipeline, investigation tools
  daemon/       Background daemon for browser session persistence
  frameworks/   Framework detection (pytest, jest, Spring, etc.)
  index.ts      Library exports
tests/
  unit/           Pure logic tests (mocks OK)
  integration/    Real debugger tests (no mocks)
  e2e/            Full MCP/CLI-to-viewport tests (no mocks)
  fixtures/       Real programs used as debug targets
  agent-harness/  Scenario-based test suite for evaluating agent debugging ability
    scenarios/    Buggy programs at 5 difficulty levels, per-language suites
docs/             Foundation docs (VISION, ARCH, UX, SPEC, ADAPTER-SDK, PRIOR_ART)
  agents.md       Navigation guide — which docs to trust, which are legacy
  legacy/         Outdated docs (ROADMAP, INTERFACE, TESTING) — do not use for current state
  designs/completed/  Historical phase design docs — all implemented
  .generated/     Auto-generated from Zod schemas (do not edit directly)
```

## Documentation Rules

- **Do not read `docs/designs/completed/`** for understanding current behavior. Those are historical design docs that guided implementation. The code and foundation docs (`docs/ARCH.md`, `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/UX.md`, `docs/VISION.md`) are the source of truth.
- **Do not read `docs/legacy/`** for current state. Those docs (ROADMAP, INTERFACE, TESTING) are outdated and misleading.
- **Do not edit `docs/.generated/`** files directly. Regenerate with `bun run generate-docs`.
- See `docs/agents.md` for full navigation guidance.

## Commands

```bash
bun install              # Install deps
bun run dev              # Run CLI in dev
bun run mcp              # Run MCP server
bun run build            # Compile binary
bun run test             # All tests
bun run test:unit        # Unit tests only (fast)
bun run test:integration # Integration tests (needs debuggers)
bun run test:e2e         # E2E tests (needs debuggers)
bun run lint             # Biome check
bun run lint:fix         # Biome auto-fix
```

## Release checklist

After tagging a release, run the install script to update the local CLI binary:

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh
```

This builds `dist/krometrail` and copies it to `~/.local/bin/krometrail`. Run this whenever you push a release so your system has the latest CLI.

## Stack

- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Validation:** Zod 4 on all boundaries (MCP inputs, adapter configs, viewport config)
- **CLI:** citty (unjs)
- **Logging:** consola
- **DAP:** @vscode/debugprotocol types + custom minimal client
- **Testing:** vitest — e2e/integration tests use real debuggers, no mocks
- **Lint/Format:** Biome

## Conventions

- Tabs for indentation, 200 char line width (Biome config)
- Validate all external inputs with Zod schemas at boundaries
- Adapters implement the `DebugAdapter` interface in `src/adapters/base.ts`
- Viewport output is the contract — if the format changes, e2e tests should break
- Do not include "Co-Authored-By" or any AI signature lines in commit messages

## Bun adapter (unsupported)

`src/adapters/bun.ts` exists but is **not registered** in `registerAllAdapters()`. Bun 1.3.x uses WebKit JSC inspector protocol (not V8 CDP) — `Debugger.paused` events never fire regardless of how breakpoints are set. js-debug is V8/CDP-only and cannot bridge to WebKit protocol. The adapter code is kept for reference. Re-enable when Bun's CDP supports programmatic pause (`Debugger.paused`), or rewrite using `@rttnd/bun-inspector-protocol` (WebKit protocol wrapper). Relevant Bun issues: #4842, #9290, #13994.
